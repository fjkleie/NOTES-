CONSTRUCTORS : 
- automatically called when a function is created, whose rule is to initialyze object's data members. there exist 4 types of constructors (copy, default, move, parameterized )

-A name is called global if it is defined outside any function, class (Chapter 10), or namespace
 (§8.2

-Function argument names are considered declared in the outermost block of a function, so
 void f5(int x):
 {
 	 int  x; / /error
 }
 is an error becausex x is defined twice in the same scope. Having this be an error allows a not
 uncommon, subtle mistake to be caught.

- If an initializer is specified for an object, that initializer determines the initial value of an object. If
 no initializer is specified, a global (§4.9.4), namespace (§8.2), or local static object (§7.1.2, §10.2.4)
 (collectively calledstatic objects) is initialized to0 0of the appropriate type. For example:
 int a; / /means ``int a = 0;''
 double d; / /means ``double d = 0.0;''
 Local variables (sometimes called automatic objects) and objects created on the free store (some
times called dynamic objects or heap objects) are not initialized by default. For example:
 void f()
 {
 	int x; / /x does not have a well-defined value
 	/ /...
 }
